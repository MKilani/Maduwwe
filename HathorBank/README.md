This database is part of the output of the PostDoc project "Wandering Words: Sociolinguistics of Loanwords in Egypt and the Ancient Near East", sponsored by Swiss National Science Foundation (Mobility Grant - P400PG_186657 )

## Description

The HathorBank database will collect Egyptian laonword of Levantine (mainly Semitic) origins attested in New Kingdom sources. The dataset will provide information on their spellings, contexts and periods of attestations, semantic fields, attested and reconstructed phonology, and on possible cognates outside Egyptian.

The data will be interlinked, through ID numbers, to the [ThotBank](ThotBank), the [Comprehensive Coptic Lexicon](http://coptic-dictionary.org/about.cgi), the [Thesaurus Linguae Aegyptiae](http://aaew.bbaw.de/tla/index.html), the [Ramses](http://ramses.ulg.ac.be), the [iClassifier](https://www.iclassifier.pw), and the [Lexibank](https://glottobank.org/#lexibank) databases.

The HathorBank is conceived as a long term project, and it is currently in its earlier phase of development. No data is available yet, but a first preliminary release is planned for spring 2020.

### Structure of the database (preliminary)

This is a preliminary version of the structure of the database; it may change in the future.

```
1) General parameters:
	- Consonantal root
	- Meaning in Egyptian

2) Chronological and geographical parameters
	- First attestation of the word
	- Periods of attestation
	- Number of attestations/period
	- Hieroglyphic spellings for each period of attestation

3) Linguistic/phonological criteria
	- Transcription
	- Normalization
	- Reconstruction of the vocalization for the period(s) of the attestation

4) Philological and literary parameters
	- Texts in which the word is present
	- Specific manuscripts of the text in which the word is attested
	- Date of composition of the text and date of production of each manuscript with an attestation of the word
	- Geographical origin of the manuscripts
	- Geographical origin of the earliest manuscript of the text
	- Nature of the text of each attestation (letter, royal inscription, literary text, etc.)
	- Textual context of the attestation (e.g. is the word used in a Levant-related episode?)

5) Demotic and Coptic descendants
	- Coptic descendants with dialectal and morphological information, and phonemic transcription
	- Demotic attestations
	- References to Coptic and Demotic dictionaries and databases

6) Pre-Coptic-Dialect-related criteria
	- Evidence for pre-Coptic dialect

7) Assimilated loanword vs. foreignism
	- Assesment according to Kilani 2019

8) Levantine cognates
	- Related words in levantine languages, with references

9) Semantic parameters
	- Tagging according to concepts from the Concepticon project 
	- Classifiers (“indigenous” semantic classification)

10) Links to other databases
	- ID in TLA
	- ID in Ramses
	- ID in iClassifier
	- ID in ThotBank
	- ID in Comprehensive Coptic Lexicon
	- ID in LexiBank
