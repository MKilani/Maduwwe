# Madùwwe : Collecting Egyptian Words

Madùwwe (/maˈduwwə/, the likely early New Kingdom pronunciation of mdw.w = "words") is a project aiming at collecting digital lexical datasets for the Ancient Egyptian language.

I have conceived the Madùwwe datasets to be used both by Egyptologists, by general historical linguists, and by computational linguists, and they are thus developped within an interdisciplinary, collaborative and opensource frame. This philosophy is reflected in the use of standardised transcriptions and transliterations, in coherent and regular encoding that makes the data easily accessible through scripts and digital methods, and in the multiple crossreferences to the databases of other major linguistic and egyptological projects.

Madàwwe is a work-in-progress project - and so are the datasets that are currently hosted here. Details on the status of the different datasets are provided in the corresponding pages.

## Datasets

### ThotBank

Status: work-in-progress

Estimated Completion Date: February 2020

Link: [ThotBank](ThotBank)

#### Description

ThotBank is a dataset of Coptic words for which an Egyptian etymology has been suggested. The datased provides the Coptic form in unicode, and automatically generated trascription, dialectal variants, translation based on the [Comprehensive Coptic Lexicon](http://coptic-dictionary.org/about.cgi) project, the suggested Egyptian etymology with references, a translation of the Egyptian form based on the [Thesaurus Linguae Aegyptiae](http://aaew.bbaw.de/tla/index.html) project, and additional related Coptic and Egyptian words.

The project is currently in developement, and new entries and new references are added regularly.

Each entry is interlinked, through ID numbers, to both the [Comprehensive Coptic Lexicon](http://coptic-dictionary.org/about.cgi) and the [Thesaurus Linguae Aegyptiae](http://aaew.bbaw.de/tla/index.html) databases.

### HathorBank

Status: work-in-progress - coming soon

Estimated Completion Date: preliminary dataset/test-case corpus: late 2020

Link: [HathorBank](HathorBank)

#### Description

The HathorBank database will collect Egyptian laonword of Levantine (mainly Semitic) origins attested in New Kingdom sources. The dataset will provide information on their spellings, contexts and periods of attestations, semantic fields, attested and reconstructed phonology, and on possible cognates outside Egyptian.

The HathorBank is conceived as a long term project, and it is currently in its earlier phase of development. No data is available yet, but a first preliminary release is planned for spring 2020.
